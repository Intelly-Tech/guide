**Step 1: Register Account**

**Step 2: Complete Verification**

You can complete Identity Verification on your Binance account to unlock the fiat deposit and withdrawal limits. This process typically takes a few minutes to complete, which includes verifying your basic account information, providing ID documentation, and uploading a selfie/portrait.

Be sure to secure your Binance account - while we do everything to keep your account secure, you also have the power to increase the security of your Binance account. See our Security Tips for more information.

**Step 3: Deposit Crypto**

If you already hold crypto in another wallet, you can deposit them into your Binance Wallet. Please refer to the FAQ here for more information on how to deposit and withdraw crypto on your Binance account.

If you are not familiar with crypto wallets, please read this Academy article [here](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/crypto-wallet-types-explained) to learn more. Please note that you should **never** share your Binance Account/Wallet passwords, private keys, or 2FA codes with anyone. Binance will never ask you to disclose sensitive information.

**Step 4: Buy Crypto**

**Deposit Fiat**

Depending on your country, you can deposit up to 50+ fiat currencies, such as EUR, BRL, and AUD to your Binance account using bank transfer and bank cards. You can find these different fiat channels here. Once deposited, you can use them to buy crypto directly.

**Buy Crypto Using Debit/Credit Card**

You can also buy crypto directly using your credit/debit card on the Binance website or the Lite Mode on the Binance App easily.

**Buy Crypto Using P2P (Peer-to-Peer)**

You can buy crypto with P2P methods, too. This allows you to buy crypto from other crypto enthusiasts like you directly. Visit this page to learn more on how to buy crypto on P2P.

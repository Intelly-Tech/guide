# Import NFT's

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Extension" %}
Please note that while you can add NFTs as custom tokens in the extension, **you will not be able to see them natively in the UI.**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mobile" %}
NFTs are displayed under **the NFT tab.** Please remember that some NFTs will not show up on the mobile app, **or may not show up correctly.**

The easiest way to display your NFTs is to turn on the app's NFT autodetect feature. See the FAQs for how to do this.

1. **Find the NFT's **_**address.**_** ** On OpenSea, for example, on the NFT's page under **Details**, there is a blue hyperlinked value labelled 'Contract Address'. If you click on this, it will take you to the contract's address on Etherscan; at the top-left of that page, there should be an icon labelled 'Contract', and to the right, a long string of letters and numbers. This is the address of the contract that created your NFT. Click on the 'copy' icon to the right of the address, and you'll have it on your clipboard.
2. In MetaMask Mobile, tap on the 'NFTs' tab, scroll down and tap on the '+ ADD NFTs' link. Paste the NFT's address from your clipboard into the 'Address' box.
3. **Find the NFT's **_**ID**_**.** A collectible's ID is a unique identifier since no two NFTs are alike. Again, on OpenSea this number is under 'Details'. Make a note of it, or copy it onto your clipboard.
4. Paste the ID into the box marked 'ID' in MetaMask Mobile, tap on the 'ADD' button, and your NFTs should appear under the NFTs tab.
